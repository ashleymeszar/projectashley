<!--The <head> element contains additional information for search engines and browsers.-->

<!--Glitch a .jpg image by editing the source code. Open the digital image file using “text/edit” on Macs (located in Launchpad/other), "Notepad" on Windows, or "text" on Chromebooks (located in App launcher). Make a test glitch: scroll down to the middle of the document. Copy, cut, move, and paste 10-20 lines of code. Hit save. Then open the original image to see what has changed. Once you understand your reference position, you can begin glitching with more precision.   
   
To add your glitch image, simply find and delete the hero.jpg file in the project folder. Then name your glitched image file to the project folder and name it "hero.jpg." If an image is larger than 1200px in width, you will want to resize it speed up load time. Crop image height to ensure desired fit.--> 

<!--The "hero-image" properties are controlled on the style.css document. We know this because the <div> calls the class="hero-image".

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is Ashley Meszar. I come from the Greensburg area, about 45 minutes away from campus. I am now residing in a dorm, as a biology student at The University of Pittsburgh. My first experience with coding and digital technology experience was in elementray school. My first ever experience with a computer was around the age of six, playing different games in my mom's office. In my technology class, one thing we went through was a fun coding website that was also a game. It wasn't like anything I've ever done before and thought it was really cool.</p>

<!--Flexbox uses rows and column classes to create layouts that scale content across devices. The style.css page provides other attributes that will adjust the image depending on the size of screens. Add images to your project folder and make sure the file name/type matches in your code. Resize images to less than 600px in width. This will improve load time accessibility. Don't forget to add alt="text"-->

<!--Conduct your own Dear Data inquiry…collecting, analyzing, and communicating data (Shout out to Dear Data authors Georgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec). Use your built-in screen time monitoring features on your phone, tablet, and computer to assist you in tracking your technology use over 5-7 days. Then create a data visualization using colored pencils, crayons, or markers that tells the story of you and your data. Here's our framing question “How do you interact with technology and in what ways? (frequency and distribution of various activities.) For example: What apps get you through your day, what kinds of media are you consuming, what kinds of websites are you using?-->
</div>
<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">Tecnology and code have impacted us by simply changing how we move through the world in the first place. It's made things easier on us. We have started relying on codes and such to learn from our interests and do things such as track data for us or correct our errors. But, it has also opened doors for our creativity, allowing us to experiment and generate new things that wouldn't have been possible years ago. By completing the Dear Data visualization, I learned that my electronics pay more attention to my usage of them than I do. The data accurately dipicted me having these apps or websites open, but not my active versus idle usage. I tend to just leave my phone open when I am actually interacting with others, but this still allots time. But, for the most part, this activity did depict that I spend the majority of my time on social platforms, entertainment apps and, education websites. I think that this project was actually pretty cool, forcing me to face my own screen usage and come up with a crative way to demonstrate it. </p>

<div class="text-block" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Code and digital technology impact on education</h2>
    <p>Digital technology and code has improved the way we learn by changing our access to materials. These new technologies and codes allow us to learn and perform tasks that were not even options beforehand. It's important to address the role that codes and computers play in our digital literacies because it has made it so much easaier to access reading materials. It saves us trips to libraries and allows to work within the texts, adding our own modifications of highlighting or adding our own notes to the pages. Addressing these advancements allows to appreciate the easier access we have now.</p>
